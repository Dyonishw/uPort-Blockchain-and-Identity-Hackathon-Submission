# uPort Blockchain and Identity Hackathon Submission

This repository consists of my submission to uPort Blockchain and Identity Hackathon.
It is by no means a production ready smart contract and it is used for testing purposes
only.

My submission consists of two potential applications: one which could potentially
store all Real Estate properties in an area/region and one which would allow users to 
buy/sell these properties.

I did my best to explain what each function does and I wrote esential shortcomings that 
I could think of at the end of the contract.

I have included a file that contains CLI commands for web3.js 0.20.0, truffle deployment files
and I have used truffle ^4.0.0 for local testing and debugging. I was unable to write unit tests,
properly debug the code or even check for critical contract logic since I ran out of 
time :) Honest feedback would be very much appreciated.
